# speakrs

Fast Rust speaker diarization (who spoke when) with pyannote-level accuracy.

On VoxConverse dev, `speakrs` CoreML gets **7.1% DER at 529x realtime** versus pyannote's 7.2% at 24x. Full results are in [benchmarks/](https://github.com/avencera/speakrs/tree/master/benchmarks).

If you want a small end-to-end app using it, see [avencera/smrze](https://github.com/avencera/smrze).

## Overview

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

`speakrs` implements the full pyannote `community-1` style diarization
pipeline in Rust: segmentation, powerset decode, overlap-add aggregation,
binarization, embedding, PLDA, and VBx clustering.

There is no Python runtime in the library path. Inference runs on ONNX
Runtime or native CoreML, and the rest of the pipeline stays in Rust.

## Usage

```toml
# macOS (CoreML)
speakrs = { version = "0.4", features = ["coreml"] }

# NVIDIA GPU
speakrs = { version = "0.4", features = ["cuda"] }

# CPU only
speakrs = "0.4"

# System OpenBLAS
speakrs = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["online", "openblas-system"] }
```

### Quick start

```rust
use speakrs::{ExecutionMode, OwnedDiarizationPipeline};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let mut pipeline = OwnedDiarizationPipeline::from_pretrained(ExecutionMode::CoreMl)?;

    let audio: Vec<f32> = load_your_mono_16khz_audio_here();
    let result = pipeline.run(&audio)?;

    print!("{}", result.rttm("my-audio"));
    Ok(())
}
```

### Speaker turns

```rust
use speakrs::pipeline::{FRAME_DURATION_SECONDS, FRAME_STEP_SECONDS};

let result = pipeline.run(&audio)?;

for segment in result
    .discrete_diarization
    .to_segments(FRAME_STEP_SECONDS, FRAME_DURATION_SECONDS)
{
    println!("{:.3} - {:.3}  {}", segment.start, segment.end, segment.speaker);
}
```

### Background queue

[`QueueSender`] and [`QueueReceiver`] run a background worker. Push audio
from any thread and read results as they finish:

```rust
use speakrs::{ExecutionMode, OwnedDiarizationPipeline, QueuedDiarizationRequest};

let pipeline = OwnedDiarizationPipeline::from_pretrained(ExecutionMode::CoreMl)?;
let (tx, rx) = pipeline.into_queued()?;

std::thread::spawn(move || {
    for (file_id, audio) in receive_files() {
        tx.push(QueuedDiarizationRequest::new(file_id, audio)).unwrap();
    }
});

for result in rx {
    let result = result?;
    print!("{}", result.result?.rttm(&result.file_id));
}
```

### Local models

For offline or airgapped setups, load models from a local directory:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use speakrs::{ExecutionMode, OwnedDiarizationPipeline};

let mut pipeline = OwnedDiarizationPipeline::from_dir(
    Path::new("/path/to/models"),
    ExecutionMode::Cpu,
)?;
let result = pipeline.run(&audio)?;
```

## Choosing a mode

| Mode | Backend | Step | Use it for |
|------|---------|------|------------|
| `cpu` | ONNX Runtime CPU | 1s | CPU runs and widest compatibility |
| `coreml` | Native CoreML | 1s | macOS with CoreML acceleration |
| `coreml-fast` | Native CoreML | 2s | macOS with CoreML acceleration and higher throughput |
| `cuda` | ONNX Runtime CUDA | 1s | NVIDIA GPU |
| `cuda-fast` | ONNX Runtime CUDA | 2s | NVIDIA GPU for higher throughput |

The `*-fast` modes move the segmentation window every 2 seconds instead of
every 1 second. That gives the pipeline fewer windows to score, so it can be much faster, but speaker changes
may land a little farther from the exact word or pause where they happened.

Use the 1 second modes when you care about exactly when each speaker starts and stops,
short clips, interviews with quick back-and-forth, or audio you plan to subtitle or edit. The 2 second modes
are usually worth trying for long recordings where speed matters more than exact speaker-change times, such as
meetings, lectures, podcasts, or bulk archives.

## Benchmarks

VoxConverse dev, collar=0ms:

| Platform | Implementation | DER | Time | RTFx |
|----------|----------------|-----|------|------|
| Apple M4 Pro | `speakrs` `coreml` | **7.1%** | 138s | 529x |
| Apple M4 Pro | `speakrs` `coreml-fast` | 7.4% | 169s | 434x |
| Apple M4 Pro | pyannote community-1 (MPS) | 7.2% | 2999s | 24x |
| RTX 4090 | `speakrs` `cuda` | **7.0%** | 1236s | 59x |
| RTX 4090 | `speakrs` `cuda-fast` | 7.4% | 604s | **121x** |
| RTX 4090 | pyannote community-1 (CUDA) | 7.2% | 2312s | 32x |

On VoxConverse test, `coreml` matches pyannote at 11.1% DER and runs at
631x realtime versus pyannote's 23x. `cuda` matches pyannote at 11.1% DER
and runs at 50x realtime versus pyannote's 18x. See
[benchmarks/](https://github.com/avencera/speakrs/tree/master/benchmarks) for
the full tables across all datasets.

CoreML and ONNX Runtime can differ slightly even in FP32 because the runtime
graphs are not identical and floating-point reduction order changes rounding.

## Why not pyannote-rs?

[pyannote-rs](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/pyannote-rs) is the main
Rust-only comparison point, but it targets a different tradeoff.

| | `speakrs` | `pyannote-rs` |
|-|-----------|---------------|
| Pipeline | Full pyannote `community-1` style pipeline | Simpler window-level pipeline |
| Aggregation | Overlap-add plus binarization | No overlap-add or binarization |
| Clustering | PLDA + VBx | Cosine threshold |
| Goal | Stay close to pyannote behavior on CPU/CUDA | Lightweight Rust diarization |

On the VoxConverse dev subset where `pyannote-rs` emits output, `speakrs`
CoreML scores 11.5% DER versus 80.2% for `pyannote-rs`. In that same run,
`pyannote-rs` returned no segments on most files.

## Models

With the default `online` feature, models download on first use from
[avencera/speakrs-models](https://huggingface.co/avencera/speakrs-models).
Set `SPEAKRS_MODELS_DIR` if you want to force a local bundle instead.

## Features and build notes

Common features:

- `online` (default): model download via [`ModelManager`]
- `coreml`: native CoreML backend on macOS
- `cuda`: NVIDIA CUDA backend via ONNX Runtime
- `load-dynamic`: load the CUDA runtime at startup instead of static linking

BLAS backends matter if you disable default features:

- `x86_64` defaults to statically linked Intel MKL
- non-`x86_64` defaults to statically linked OpenBLAS and needs a C toolchain
- no-default builds must enable exactly one of `intel-mkl`, `openblas-static`, or `openblas-system`

```toml
speakrs = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["online", "intel-mkl"] }
speakrs = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["online", "openblas-system"] }
```

The ONNX Runtime dependency (`ort` 2.0.0-rc.12) is still pre-release.
